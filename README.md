## File Naming Convention

Please follow this naming convention below.
The file name is divided into 3 different parts:
- **Penyisihan**: The first part differentiates between each competition stage.
- **A**: The second part is used to label which question of the stage.
- **your_name**: The last part is to label the file with your name on it. Please note that they're all in a capital case and replace the spaces with underscore.

An example of the file is as follows:
```
Penyisihan-A-Kevin_Bramasta_Arvyto_Wardhana
```

## Do's and Don'ts

- Please submit all your jobsheets as a Pull Request with the appropriate title to avoid confusion.
- Please submit your file outside of the question folder.
- Please write the stage name, the question type, and your name as the Pull Request title. For example: `[Penyisihan-A]: Kevin Bramasta Arvyto Wardhana`
